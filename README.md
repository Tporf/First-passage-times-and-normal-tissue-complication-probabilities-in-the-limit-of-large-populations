# First-passage-times-and-normal-tissue-complication-probabilities-in-the-limit-of-large-populations
This project aims to leverage stochastic methods to analyze how cell populations respond to radiation therapy, focusing on the Normal Tissue Complication Probability (NTCP) and the first-passage time problem.
